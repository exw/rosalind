Per their explanation at rosalind.info, learning bioinformatics usually requires solving computational problems of varying difficulty that are extracted from real challenges of molecular biology. Rosalind is a platform for learning bioinformatics through problem solving. Rosalind offers an array of intellectually stimulating problems that grow in biological and computational complexity; each problem is checked automatically, so that the only resource required to learn bioinformatics is an internet connection.

I heard about this from a guy I met on 7cupsoftea, an Indian native working for a big data analytics company using Hadoop and Spark. We bonded over coding, UIUC, and post-rock like EITS and Porcupine Tree.

Problems were completed in Python 2 with the help of online compiler Ideone.com, for a quick cross-platform solution. I may try to complete these problems again with functional solutions in Scala at a later time. I strayed from my preferred online IDE codepad.org, because the needed an input source and Ideone offers stdin capabilities.
