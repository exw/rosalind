Per their explanation at rosalind.info, learning bioinformatics usually requires solving computational problems of varying difficulty that are extracted from real challenges of molecular biology. Rosalind is a platform for learning bioinformatics through problem solving. Rosalind offers an array of intellectually stimulating problems that grow in biological and computational complexity; each problem is checked automatically, so that the only resource required to learn bioinformatics is an internet connection.
